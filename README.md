```
git clone https://github.com/n0l3r/tiktok-downloader.git
cd tiktok-downloader
npm i
node index
```
 **Note**
 
 You will need to create a downloads folder in the ```/tiktok-downloader``` folder, otherwise this will throw out an error.
 Be careful with the tiktok channels you download on, as this will take a while to download 100+ videos.
